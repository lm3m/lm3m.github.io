summary: Sometimes all you can do is keep moving forward 
---

Some days you just have to feel like you are a shark. 

Not powerful, nor a predator, just a fish with one big problem. 

The problem being: if you stop moving you die. 

(Now, I don't know if that _factoid_ is true, but it does not really matter.)

The feeling is what matters. 

Rather than focusing on all the shit, everything you have to do, just do one thing. And then, another. 

Rather than gtting weighed down by the crushing power of everything that is in front of you, focus on what is right in front of you. 

And, do it.

Just keep moving.

Somedays, it is all you can do.
