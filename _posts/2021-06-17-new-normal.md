summary: What is going to be the new normal
---

So, for the first time in over a year I headed into work yesterday.
Strange feeling, I still want to wear a mask and avoid touching people, not a germophobe, but just conscious of the fact that humans are pretty disgusting as a whole maybe we should be a bit less ready to touch each other. Or maybe I am a germophobe.

Checked my rewiring of all my synths and it was fucked. OOPS. And it seems the sub-$50 patch panel I bought might be kind of crappy. Go figure. Anyway soon I will have all of the synths hooked up in such a way where I can route each one through effects or the modular as needed. Pretty slick. 

Need to work on Son of CTHUGHA, again. Really want to add in video capture. heh.
