Watched Foundation and Jupiter's Legacy this weekend. Jupiter's Legacy was totally the weaker of the two. Actually better than the comic in some ways, but not working much better.

Foundation on the other hand, was impressive. It took a book that in many ways was thought to be un-filmable, and turned it into something compelling. The problem with The Foundation series, is that it relied on one of the problems of Asimov's writing style, and used it as an asset. If all your protagonists are so thin that they are effectively fungible, then jumping across thousands of years in story does not really confuse the reader. Which is harder to do in TV, and they really have not reached that point in the series, where they need to abandon the first set of characters for ones thousands of years later. Maybe they will find a way to pull a single character through the whole narrative. Anyway, after the first couple of episodes, I am here to find out.

Gunpla update: Built my Zaku, and panel lined it. Panel lining is where you take a marker or paint to outline the details of the plastic model. It brings out the details and really makes the models pop. You can either use a fine tipped marker, or paint. Usually grey for white plastic, black for blue plastic, and brown for red plastic, you are shooting for shadows. The Zaku came out pretty well. Had stickers, but skipped most of those.

Also, I have been watching the original Gundam series (from the late 70's) and though it has not aged well, there are some parts I really enjoy. The basic story is that one of Earth's colonies has declared it independence, war breaks out, and a ton of people have died on both sides. The Zeon (the separatists) and the Earth Federation wage this war with little concern for the people who they are supposedly fighting for. Neither side comes off well, the Federation bureaucratic and unfeeling, the Zeon are authoritarian and built on a cult of personality, but both are pretty awful. The compelling part of the series, when they let them through is all the characters caught up in the war. But, most of the time the series focuses on overly episodic type stories.

Makes me think about how you would tell a story like this, two people caught up in the wrong side of a war, with giant mecha. You have to have a light dose of science in there, but since you already buying into piloting giant human shaped war machines, there is a bit of disbelief you have to be willing to give the story. I have some thoughts percolating, going to save them for later.

Moses and Kat are heading to Tinkerer Town.
