I need to have something to work on with my hands. I could be electronics projects, painting miniatures, but for now it is assembling Gunpla. A portmanteau of Gundam and Plastic Model, Gunpla a overly intricate plastic model kits. They typically are made for the mecha in the multitude of Gundam anime. But, they make Eva and other anime mecha as well. The thing that sets Gunpla apart is the detail and articulation of the models, along with the complexity. It is like a giant Lego set where you get an action figure after you are done. I enjoy the process and it really is satisfying putting the figures together. Some people paint them, I really am not interesting in painting them, but I am going to panel line (outline the panels to bring out the detail of the model) my next one.

Music front, I made a nice little jam with my dawless rig. Using my Roland MC-101 as a clock source and later percussion, and starting from the Behringer Crave, I brought in both the Behringer Model-D and the Behringer TD-3 for a strange little ambient jam.

Writing is still slow, many mornings I just don't find time to write (with selling the house and working from home and working out, hard to imagine why) weekends are good. And some nights, but Kat and Moses and still looking for their missing demon friend Hank.

Work continues on. Finding a good rhythm. And like what I work on.

-luke, building a Zaku this weekend.
